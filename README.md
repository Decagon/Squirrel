Quickly download minimaps to images from Everybody Edits.

To download a minimap, there are two options:
- use the initialization data (the latest data available.) Requires authentication.
- use BigDB data (latest data as of last save.) No authentication required.
 
Minimaps are downloaded and converted into *.png files in about 1.5 seconds on an average connection, after the connection object has been initialized.
